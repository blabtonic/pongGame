DESCRIPTION:
Simple pong game that I am creating. Will add the a couple features from the to-dos list I have below.

CONTROLS:
Player 1 uses "w" for going up and "s" for going down 

Player 2 uses the up arrow keys for moving up and down arrow keys for moving down

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of pong is simple: try to get the ball to the other side of your opponents and to prevent the ball going through to your side. Once the ball goes through the opponent's side a point is awarded to you

HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK:
As long as you have love 0.9.1 installed on your computer,
create a zip file with all the contents of this game and rename the .zip to .love and then you should be
able to play


TO-DOS:
Finish game(obviously)
Make sound at startup state at launch of game
